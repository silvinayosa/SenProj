WE ARE ALL VERY TIRED. AND WE ONLY HAVE ROUGHLY 5 MONTHS LEFT TO FINISH THIS GOSH DANG PROJECT. SO EVERYONE, CHAIYOO!!!!

AND BTW, NO MORE **ZIP FILES** BECAUSE WHAT'S THE POINT OF UPLOADING **ZIP FILES** TO GITHUB??

WE USE GITHUB BECAUSE WE WANT TO TRACE PROGRESSES, WHICH ARE DAILY AND WEEKLY COMMITS. SO PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF JESUS, NO MORE **Z-Z-Z-Z-ZIP FILES**


Fighting GUYS 5 MONTHS to go we need to make our website fully functional and give the best impressions ðŸ”¥. Thanks, Peter for the feedback
